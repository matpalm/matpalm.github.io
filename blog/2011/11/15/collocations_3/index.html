  <h2>finding phrases with mutual information</h2>
<p>continuing on with my series of <a href="/blog/2011/10/22/collocations_1/">mutual information experiments</a> how might 
   we extend the technique to identity sequences longer than just two terms?
</p>
<p>one novel way is to identify the bigrams of interest, replace them with a single token and simply repeat 
   the entire process. (thanks <a href="http://tdunning.blogspot.com">ted</a> for the idea)
</p>

<h2>example</h2>
<p>so say we had the 6 term sentence <tt>i went to new york city</tt>
</p>
<p>it has 5 bigrams; <tt>('i went', 'went to', 'to new', 'new york', 'york city')</tt>
</p>
<p>running the mutual information algorithm over this might identify <tt>new york</tt> 
   as a bigram of interest. 
</p>
<p>we can swap the two terms with a single token 
   <tt>(new_york)</tt> giving us a new sentence with 5 terms; <tt>i went to '(new_york)' city</tt>
</p>
<p>this new sentence has 4 bigrams <tt>('i went', 'went to', 'to (new_york)', '(new_york) city')</tt>
</p>
<p>another run of mutual information might now identify the pair <tt>(new_york) city</tt> so we replace 
   it with the token <tt>((new_york)_city)</tt> and just keep repeating.
</p>

<h2>data</h2>
<p>lets run this over a small sample of 300,000 sentences taken from visible text of 
   the <a href="http://download.freebase.com/wex/">freebase wiki dump</a> after it's been tokenised by 
   <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml">the stanford parser</a>
</p>
<p>(to speed things a little i calculate mutual information and replace the top 10 bigrams in the text before recalculating)
</p>
<p>example starting sentences include...

<h2>results</h2>

<h3>what phrases do we find?</h3>
<p>after the first iteration we get the bigrams we've seen before...
</p>
<pre>
Socorro LINEAR
expr    expr
United  States
Los     Angeles
median  income
</pre>

<hr>

<p>but after the second iteration we get a mix of single term bigrams and immediately 
   start seeing some new composite bigrams; in this case the trigram <tt>'per square mile'</tt>
</p>
<pre>
(expr_expr)     (expr_expr)
capita  income
(t_t)   t
per     (square_mile)
Las     Vegas
</pre>

<p>unfortunately there's lots of noise too. <tt>'expr expr expr expr'</tt> comes from an single sentence, the term 'expr' repeated 450 times, 
   that must have been poorly parsed originally. the <tt>'t t t</tt>' case is something similar.
</p>
<hr>

<p>by the 16th iteration we get our first 4gram phrase <tt>' U.S. fair use laws'</tt>
</p>
<pre>
had     been
U.S.    ((fair_use)_laws)
Rotten  Tomatoes
science fiction
(New_York)      City
</pre>

<hr>

<p>and by the 70th iteration we get our first 5gram phrase <tt>'United Nations Security Council Resolution'</tt>.
   jujitsu fans out there will be pleased to see some grappling coming in too!
</p>
<p>alas more rubbish as well with the align styling tags leaking in.
</p>
<pre>
(((United_Nations)_Security)_Council)   Resolution
Submission      (rear_(naked_choke))
Asian   (Pacific_Islander)
(UD_(align_left))       ((align_left)_((align_center)_(Win_(align_left))))
lieutenant      colonel
</pre>

<hr>

<p>it's only two passes later that we get a big continuation of this one 
   with <tt>'United Nations Security Council Resolution adopted unanimously'</tt>
</p>
<pre>
(((((United_Nations)_Security)_Council)_Resolution)_adopted)    unanimously
(United_States) ((align_left)_((align_center)_(Win_(align_left))))
Flying  Corps
Saddam  Hussein
TKO     punches
</pre>

<p>i was a bit suspicous of this one but grabbing the original text we can see
   how it makes for an interesting construct in the text...

<p>interesting. i wonder has this come from a template perhaps? maybe just cut n paste? one author with fixed style?
</p>
<hr>

<p>even by the end of my run, 950 iterations, (aka last night) there continue to be valid 
   short phrases being picked up
</p>
<pre>
(County_Kansas) (United_States)
County  Clare
Sunday  night
Rift    Valley
Charlton        Heston
</pre>


<h3>how has the corpus changed?</h3>
<p>during the processing we've been replacing these tokens in the original text. 
   so how does it look by this time? well, not a whole lot has changed actually. 
</p>
<p>the following 3 random examples show how little the text differs
   (should have left it running much longer!!)
</p>
<pre>
(He_played) for a (short_time) with (Duke_Ellington) for (which_he) is (best_remembered)

His (debut_single) Mi God Mi King topped the Jamaican (singles_chart) and a string of hits
followed including Heel And Toe Monkey And Ape (Ghost_Rider) and Crucifixion although his
best-remembered song is Mini Bus which lamented the demise (of_the) jolly bus and which 
(was_awarded) the title Song Of The Year in (from_the) Jamaica (Broadcasting_Corporation)

However this number is certainly an improvement (from_the) cars it averaged yearly ((during_the)_1980s)
</pre>


<h3>what are the longest phrases identified?</h3>
<p>the top three are noise alas...
</p>
<table class="data">
<tr> <td>rank</td> <td>num</br>underscores</td> <td>phrase</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>1</td> <td>127</td> <td>expr_expr_expr_..... (128 times)</td></tr>
<tr> <td>2</td> <td>95</td>  <td>September_Socorro_LINEAR_September_Socorro_LINEAR_... (32 times)</td></tr>
<tr> <td>3</td> <td>63</td>  <td>t_t_t_... (64 times)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>it's not until the 77th we get something that isn't (arguably) just a repeated 
   pattern or noisy parsing
</p>
<table class="data">
<tr> <td>rank</td> <td>num</br>underscores</td> <td>phrase</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>77</td> <td>10</td><td> At_the_census_there_were_people_households_and_families_residing_in </td></tr>
</table>

<p>which were identified as phrases due to the large frequency of occurances of variations of the following...
</p>
<table class="data">
<tr> <td>freq</td> <td>original phrase</td> </tr>
<tr><td> 72 </td> <td>As of the census of there were people households and families residing in the city      </td> </tr>
<tr><td>     60 </td> <td>As of the census of there were people households and families residing in the town      </td> </tr>
<tr><td>     46 </td> <td>As of the census of there were people households and families residing in the CDP       </td> </tr>
<tr><td>     32 </td> <td>As of the census of there were people households and families residing in the village   </td> </tr>
<tr><td>     26 </td> <td>As of the census of there were people households and families residing in the township  </td> </tr>
<tr><td>     15 </td> <td>As of the census of there were people households and families residing in the borough   </td> </tr>
<tr><td>      3 </td> <td>At the census there were people households and families residing in the city  </td> </tr>
<tr><td>      2 </td> <td>At the census there were people households and families residing in the village </td> </tr>
<tr><td>      2 </td> <td>As of the census of there were people households and families residing on the base      </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>fascinating stuff!!
</p>

<h2>random todo thoughts</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
     use patterns found in this experiment to clean up noise and rerun
 </li>

 <li>
     work out a way to fold the composition into the scoring
 </li>

 <li>
     work on larger dataset
 </li>

 <li>
     approach to dealing with duplicates? don't want to just uniq since they represent something 
 </li>
</ul>
