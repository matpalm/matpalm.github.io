<h2>questions</h2>
<p>a <a href="http://xkcd.com/903/">recent</a> xkcd posed the idea...
</p>
<p><i>wikipedia trivia: if you take any article, click on the first link in the article text not in parentheses or italics, and then repeat, you will eventually end up at Philosophy.</i>
</p>
<p>this raises a number of questions
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     Q: though i wouldn't be surprised if it's true for <em>most</em> articles it can't be true for <em>all</em> articles. can it?
 </li>

 <li>
     Q: what's the distribution of distances (measured in "number of clicks away") from 'Philosophy'?
 </li>

 <li>
     Q: by this same measure what's the furthest article from 'Philosophy'?
 </li>

 <li>
     Q: are there any other articles that are more common than 'Philosophy'?
 </li>

 <li>
     Q: what are the common paths to 'Philosophy'?
 </li>
</ol>
<p>there's only one way to find out!
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     grab a wikipedia dump
 </li>

 <li>
     build the graph of 'article' to 'first link to next article' (not in parentheses or italics)
 </li>

 <li>
     do breadth first search backwards from 'Philosophy' and see what things look like
 </li>
</ol>
<hr>


<h2>getting and processing the data</h2>
<p>for my first attempt i tried to use the <a href="http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/WEX">freebase wikipedia dump</a>. my thought was it'd be easier
   to deal with a preparsed dataset but it didn't turn out.
</p>
<p>two big problems....
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     lots of information has been lost in the preparsing (eg. it was sometimes hard to determine if the first links were from the main body of text or from a sidebar )
 </li>

 <li>
     some pages weren't parsed properly at all and were just blank; included ones like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks">Greeks</a>
which ended up being pretty important.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>instead i went for a <a href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/">raw wikimedia dump</a>, in particular enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2.
   the version at the time of writing this blog was 7gb compressed &amp; 30gb uncompressed. it's already up to 9gb as of Feb 2013!
</p>
<p>for preprocessing there were a number of steps
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     split the dataset into pages that represent redirects and the actual articles themselves
 </li>

 <li>
     dereference all the redirects (to avoid redirects that redirect to other redirects)
 </li>

 <li>
     parse all the articles; the crux of this is done with <a href="http://code.pediapress.com/wiki/wiki/mwlib">mwlib</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/matpalm/wikipediaPhilosophy/blob/master/article_parser.py">article_parser.py</a>; to make a big list of edges of 'from' nodes (the article) and 'to' nodes (the first applicable link on the article page)
 </li>

 <li>
     dereference the edges to make sure all redirects have been followed
 </li>
</ol>
<p>some general statements before we go further
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     wikipedia is under heavy edit churn. i've been doing this project in 15-30 minutes chunks for a few weeks and it's amazing
      how often i'd compare the parsing to live wikipedia and find out a page had already subtely changed. god knows what it looks like currently.
 </li>

 <li>
     i wrote all the code for this in python as i'm trying to move away from ruby to get better data related library support. everything in fact <em>except</em> for
the depth first search which i did in java. the full graph as a dict was <em>insanely</em> slow to access, i must be doing something wrong.
for the full details see
<a href="http://www.github.com/matpalm/wikipediaPhilosophy">the code on this project</a>. git cloning the project and executing the README
as a shell script may [1] do something close to all the steps from start to finish. <small>[1] or it might not</small>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>the end result of the parsing is a list of 3.6e6 edges of the form 'article' -&gt; 'first link to next article' (after following redirects).
</p>
<p>all the 'article's are unique but there are only 500e3 distinct 'next article's which is already very interesting; it means less than 15% of articles
   on wikipedia are represented by one of these first links; this graph is very "bushy" (ie lots of leaf nodes).
</p>
<p>to calculate the distance from 'Philosophy' for all articles it's a straight forward
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth_first_search">breadth first search</a> and
   because this search doesnt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_cycle">cycle</a> back to 'Philosophy' again it ends
   up building a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)">tree</a>.
</p>

<h2>the results</h2>
<p>with this tree we can start answering some of our original questions ...
</p>
<hr>


<h3>Q: though i wouldn't be surprised if it's true for <em>most</em> articles it can't be true for <em>all</em> articles. can it?</h3>
<p>seems it's not true for all articles; 3.5e6 articles lead to 'Philosophy' but 100e3 don't.
</p>
<p>these 100e3 fall into two types
</p>
<p>1) 50e3 of them end up in cycles. this is a remarkably low count given 3.5e6 make it to 'Philosophy'.
</p>
<p>the vast majority of the cycles are of length 2; eg <strong>Waste management -&gt; Waste collection -&gt; Waste management</strong>
</p>
<p>( my favorite that i stumbled across is <strong>Sand fence -&gt; Snow fence -&gt; Sand fence</strong></br>
   the first sentence of Snow fence being "A snow fence is a structure, similar to a sand fence ..."</br>
   the first sentence of Sand fence being "A sand fence is a structure similar to a snow fence ..." )
</p>
<p>2) the other 50e3 are dead ends; all sorts of examples for this, mainly around pages that were never written or have been deleted.
</p>
<p>eg <strong>Windsurfing -&gt; Surface water sports -&gt; Discing</strong> (which has deleted)
</p>
<hr>


<h3>Q: what's the distribution of distances of articles from 'Philosophy'?</h3>
<p>the bulk of the articles are between 10 to 30 clicks away...
</p>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/wikipediaPhilosophy/num_articles__number_clicks__philosophy.png"/>

<p>i've trimmed this graph at 70 clicks away since there's a long tail of one single path that is 1001 articles long.
</p>
<p><strong>List of state leaders in 1977 -&gt; List of state leaders in 1976 -&gt; List of state leaders in 1975 -&gt;
.... -&gt; List of state leaders in 1001 -&gt; List of state leaders in 1000 -&gt; Fatimid Caliphate -&gt; Arab people
-&gt; Panethnicity -&gt; Ethnic group -&gt; Social group -&gt; Social sciences -&gt; List of academic disciplines
-&gt; Academia -&gt; Community -&gt; Living -&gt; Life -&gt; Physical body -&gt; Physics -&gt; Natural science -&gt; Science
-&gt; Knowledge -&gt; Fact -&gt; Information -&gt; Sequence -&gt; Mathematics -&gt; Quantity -&gt; Property (philosophy)
-&gt; Modern philosophy -&gt; Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<p>seems a bit of a "meta article" outlier we can ignore.
</p>
<p>( there's an interesting dip at a distance of 19 too; wonder what's going on there? )
</p>
<hr>


<h3>Q: what's the furthest article from 'Philosophy'?</h3>
<p>'Violet &amp; Daisy' is the longest chain i found that didn't include "meta" pages with some kind of sequence number in it. it's 36 articles from 'Philosophy'.
</p>
<p><strong>Violet &amp; Daisy -&gt; Saoirse Ronan -&gt; BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role -&gt; British Academy Film Awards -&gt;
 British Academy of Film and Television Arts -&gt; David Lean -&gt; Order of the British Empire -&gt; Chivalric order -&gt; Knight -&gt;
 Warrior -&gt; Combat -&gt; Violence -&gt; Psychological manipulation -&gt; Social influence -&gt; Conformity -&gt; Unconscious mind -&gt;
 Germans -&gt; Germanic peoples -&gt; Proto-Indo-Europeans -&gt; Proto-Indo-European language -&gt; Linguistic reconstruction -&gt;
 Internal reconstruction -&gt; Language -&gt; Human -&gt; Extant taxon -&gt; Biology -&gt; Natural science -&gt; Science -&gt; Knowledge -&gt;
 Fact -&gt; Information -&gt; Sequence -&gt; Mathematics -&gt; Quantity -&gt; Property (philosophy) -&gt; Modern philosophy -&gt; Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<hr>


<h3>Q: are there any other articles that are "more common" than 'Philosophy'?</h3>
<p>with 95+% of articles clicking through to 'Philosophy' it's not possible for there to be another unconnected graph with an article more represented than
   'Philosophy'.
</p>
<p>but if we <em>continue</em> to click through past 'Philosophy' we see we're in a short cycle of 12 articles...
</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy -&gt; Reason -&gt; Natural science -&gt; Science -&gt; Knowledge -&gt; Fact -&gt; Information -&gt; Sequence -&gt; Mathematics -&gt;
 Quantity -&gt; Property (philosophy) -&gt; Modern philosophy -&gt; Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<p>so really <em>any</em> of these are reasonable candidates and are equally good as 'Philosophy' itself for this game.
</p>
<hr>


<h3>Q: what are the common paths into 'Philosophy'?</h3>
<p>as mentioned the breadth first search builds a tree of articles with 'Philosophy' at it's root.
</p>
<p>one metric we can assign to each article in this tree is the number of descendant articles it has.</br>
   'Philosophy', as the root, has all articles as descendants so it's number is 3.5e6 and it's rank 1.</br>
   the next ranked by number of descendants is 'Modern philosophy' with 3.4e6 descendants;
   ( ie of the 3.5e6 articles that eventually led to 'Philosophy' only 100e3 of them <em>didn't</em> click through 'Modern Philosophy').
</p>
<p>by ranking articles by this metric we can observe the core structure of the tree.
</p>
<p><hr>
   in fact for the top 10 ranked articles it's hardly a tree, just the chain ...
</p>
<p><a href="http://matpalm.com/wikipediaPhilosophy/top10.png"><img src="http://matpalm.com/wikipediaPhilosophy/top10.png" width="100%"/></a>
</p>
<p><small>(width of the edge is proportional to the number of descendants)</small>
</p>
<p>it turns out that 3e6 articles (85% of the lot) get to 'Philosophy' through 'Science'.
</p>
<p><hr>
   in fact it's not until we consider up to the 20th ranked item, 'Biology', before it actually becomes a tree structure ...
</p>
<p><a href="http://matpalm.com/wikipediaPhilosophy/top20.png"><img src="http://matpalm.com/wikipediaPhilosophy/top20.png" width="100%"/></a>
</p>
<p><small>(click for a bigger version)</small>
</p>
<p><hr>
   when we consider the top 200 things start to look a bit more interesting ...
</p>
<script src="http://zoom.it/adTw.js?width=auto&height=500px"></script>

<p><hr>
   and by the top 1000 things are starting to lose an obvious core structure ...
</p>
<script src="http://zoom.it/QyGA.js?width=auto&height=500px"></script>

<p>( though dot's a pretty poor layout engine for this one, i should redo this one )
</p>

<h2>conclusions</h2>
<p>so i managed to answer the main questions i had, but it's a fun dataset so there's lots more to do yet!
</p>
<p>todos include
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     a better layout for the top 1000 or so
 </li>

 <li>
     redo with a more recent wiki dump to see what's changed
 </li>

 <li>
     what happened at a depth of 19 articles?
 </li>
</ol>
