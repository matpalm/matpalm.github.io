  <p>for the last few months i've been tinkering on/off with a half baked sequential pix2pix model.
   it's got a lot of TODOs to make it work but i've been  distracted by something else and i'll feel less
   guilty about dropping it temporarily if i scrappily write a blog post at least...
</p>

<h2>roadtrip!</h2>
<p>for the last month we lived in the U.S. we drove around california, utah, nevada and colorado in a huge RV.
   occsionally i had a time lapse running on my phone which resulted in 16,000 or so stills.
</p>

<img src="/blog/imgs/2019/p2p4rt/random_4.png"/>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>to get a sense of the time between frames here are three sequential ones ...
</p>
<table class="data">

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>can we train a \( next\_frame \) model that given two frames predicts the next?
   if so, can we use it for generation by rolling out frames and feeding them back in.
</p>
<p>( i saw an awesome example of this a few years ago when someone did this for view out the side of a train but
   can't find the reference now sadly :( if you know the project, please let me know! )
</p>

<h2>v1 model</h2>
<p>the simplest formulation is just \( \hat{f_3} = next\_frame(f_1, f_2) \)
</p>
<p>we encode frames f1 and f2 using a shared encoder, concat the representations,
   do a little more encoding then decode back to an image.
   we just train on the L1 difference \(L1(f_3, \hat{f_3})\)
</p>
<img src="/blog/imgs/2019/p2p4rt/model_v1.png"/>

<p>completely unsurprisingly, given this loss, the model just learns a weird blurry middle ground for
   all possible frames. pretty standard for L1.
</p>
<p>note: i test here on a particularly difficult sequence that has pretty rare features (other cars!!) to
   get some vague sense of how much it's memorising things...
</p>
<table class="data">
<tr><td>example rollout of v1 model</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="/blog/imgs/2019/p2p4rt/model_v1_rollout_eg.png"/>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>v2 model</h2>
<p>when we train the v1 model, let's consider how we use it for rollouts;
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     we start with two known frames, \( f_1, f_2 \)
 </li>

 <li>
     we predict the third frame by running these through the model...
     \( \hat{f_3} = next\_frame(f_1, f_2) \)
 </li>

 <li>
     we predict the fourth frame by refeeding this back in...
     \( \hat{f_4} = next\_frame(f_2, \hat{f_3}) \)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>this fails for too reasons; the L1 loss as before just isn't that good but additionally in the last
   step we're asking the model to make a prediction about a frame after \( \hat{f_3} \) and given \( \hat{f_3} \)
   isn't that much like what it's seen before, the network produces an even worse output and the problems compound.
</p>
<p>interestingly though for the \( \hat{f_4} = next\_frame(f_2, \hat{f_3}) \) case we actually knew what
   it should have been, \( f_4 \), and we can use this info. basically we can tell the
   model "look, if this is how you're screwing up \( \hat{f_3} \), at the very least here's some info about how to
   get back on track for \( f_4 \)"
</p>
<p>this idea of using a later label to give direction for a intermediate prediction is called teacher forcing
   and it's trivial to add it in by just resharing a bunch of the existing pieces to make the model
   predict not just the next frame, but the next two frames \( \hat{f_3}, \hat{f_4} = next\_frames(f_1, f_2) \)
</p>
<img src="/blog/imgs/2019/p2p4rt/model_v2.png"/>

<p>we train this model on the sum of the L1 losses for \( f_3 \) and \( f_4 \)
   but continue to just use the v1 model section of the network for rollouts.
</p>
<p>this teacher forcing gives a bit of help and things maybe improve a bit but it's still not great.
</p>
<p>note: if you can see an RNN growing here you wouldn't be too far off. in hindsight maybe i should just
   stick an LSTM between the final encoder and the decoder stacks :/

<h2>v3 model</h2>
<p>the obvious next level up from L1 is to introduce a GAN loss. since the generators output is two sequential frames
   we make this the input for the discriminator.
</p>
<img src="/blog/imgs/2019/p2p4rt/model_v3.png"/>

<p>curiously this fails in a way i haven't seen before in a GAN...
   the output of G oscillates between two different modes.
   something weird to do with Gs output being two frames?
</p>

<tr><td>example rollout of v3 model with oscillation</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="/blog/imgs/2019/p2p4rt/model_v3_rollout_osc_eg.png"/>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>if i can change D's input to be a single frame the oscillation goes away, but the results are still
   pretty crappy.
</p>
<p>anyways, based on other models i've worked on that have components like this one (e.g.
   <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/closing-simulation-to-reality-gap-for.html">graspgan</a> and
   <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/counting_bees">bnn</a> ) i know i'm at the point of tuning and tinkering
   but i've been distracted by something else in the short term... i'll come back to though one day...
