<h2>the algorithm</h2>

<h3>partitioning and pivots</h3>

<p>
not suprisingly it turns out doing a complete sort is a bit wasteful if we're only after the median.</br>
all we want is the element that had the same number of elements on either side.</br>
this type of operation, known as a partition, is actually the basis of that most famous sort of all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a>. 
</p>

<p>
the basic method of the quicksort algorithm is to select an element, called a pivot and move it into it's correct sorted position by shuffling elements around it.</br>
all elements less than the pivot are moved to the front of the list and the rest, corresponding to elements equal or greater, are left in place.</br>
after this partitioning the pivot is in it's correct sorted position (though the rest of the list is still a shambles).</br>
the rest can be sorted by recursively applying the same partitioning approach to both the elements
before the pivot and the elements after the pivot.
</p>

<p>
to find just the median though we can use the idea partitioning around the first pivot, without having to do the extra work of the complete sort.
</p>

<h3>order statistics</h3>
<p>
first an informal definition: regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistics">order statistics</a></br>
the n<sup>th</sup> order statistic of a list is the element which is in the n<sup>th</sup> postition when the list is sorted</br>
eg the 1<sup>st</sup> order statistic of a 9 element list is the minimum</br>
eg the m<sup>th</sup> order statistic of a m element list is the maximum</br>
eg the m<sup>th</sup> order statistic of a 2m element list is the median</br>
</p>

<h3>pivot selection</h3>

<h4>the perfect pivot</h4>

<p>
let's work through an example</br>
say we have the list</br>
<pre>[4 3 1 1 5 <u>9</u> 2 6 5 3 5]</pre>
(we'll use an underline to denote the value in the mth order stat position for a 2m element list)</br>
</p>

<p>
we are after the median, ie the 6th order stat</br>
if we partitioned around the first list element, ie 4, the list would be</br>
<pre>[<font color="red">3 1 1 2 3</font> <u><strong>4</strong></u> <font color="green">5 9 6 5 5</font>]</pre>
(we'll use <font color="red">red</font> values to denote those less than a pivot, <font color="green">green</font> values for those equal or greater than a pivot)

</p>
since the 4 has been moved to position 6 we can say 4 is the 6th order statistic of this list.</br>
which, as luck would have it, is exactly what we were looking for!</br>
so this pivot, 4, is the median.</br>
</p>

<p>
this was much less work than quicksort since we didn't have to sort the sublists <font color="red">[3 1 1 2 3]</font> or <font color="green">[5 9 6 5 5]</font></br>
but it only worked because 4 was a good choice.</br>
but what if after the parititioning the pivot isn't the 6th order stat?
</p>

<h4>a pivot to the right of the median postition</h4>

<p>
consider a case then the pivot ends up "to the right" of the median postition</br>
<pre>L1 = [6 3 1 1 5 <u>9</u> 2 4 5 3 7]</pre>
if we partitioned around the first element, 6, we have</br>
<pre>L1 = [<font color="red">3 1 1 5 5 <u>2</u> 4 3</font> <strong>6</strong> <font color="green">9 7</font>]</pre>
</p>

<p>
this time we have calculated 6 to be the 9th order statistic.</br>
since we were after the 6th order stat so know then that 6 is not the median.</br>
furthermore since the 9th order stat is "to the right" of the 6th order stat we know then that the median must be less than 6.</br>
therefore not only do we know 6 is not the median, it can't be 9 or 7 either.</br>
this is very important since it means we can actually discard these values completely.</br>
<pre>L2 = L1 - [6 9 7]</pre>
<pre>L2 = [3 1 1 5 5 <u>2</u> 4 3]</pre>
</p>

<p>
<i>L1's 6th order stat, it's median, is L2's 6th order stat</i></br>
(since we discarded values <i>after</i> the middle value we can continue by looking for the same order stat)</br>
</p>

<p>
take note though that the 6th order stat of L2 is <b>not</b> L2's median.</br>
L2's median would be it's 4th order stat. 
</p>

<h4>a pivot to the left of the median postition</h4>

<p>
consider a case then the pivot ends up "to the left" of the median postition</br>
<pre>L1 = [2 3 1 1 5 <u>9</u> 3 6 5 3 5]</pre>
again we are after the median which is the 6th order stat</br>
</p>

<p>
partitioning around the first element, 2, we have
<pre>L1 = [<font color="red">1 1</font> <strong>2</strong> <font color="green">3 5 <u>9</u> 3 6 5 3 5</font>]</pre>
</p>

<p>
in this case our pivot is the 3rd order stat, but we were after the 6th order stat</br>
since the 3rd order stat is "to the left" of the 6th order stat we can additionally say the median isn't 1</br>
discarding this time values less than the pivot</br>
<pre>L2 = L1 - [1 1]</pre>
<pre>L2 = [2 3 5 <u>9</u> 3 6 5 3 5]</pre>
               
<p>
<i>L1's 6th order stat, it's median, is L2's 4th order stat</i></br>
(since we discarded values <i>before</i> the middle value we need to adjust what order stat we are now looking for)</br>
</p>

<h3>in summary</h3>

<p>
if we are looking for the kth order stat and we choose a pivot that is it we've found the median.</br>
otherwise we throw some values away, adjust what order stat we're looking for and continue.
</p>

<a name="rotation"></a>
<h3>corner case</h3>

<p>what a surprise, there is a corner case....</p>

<p>
say we have list</br>
<pre>L1 = [2 3 1 1 5 <u>9</u> 3 6 5 3 5]</pre>
and we choose the first value, 2, as a pivot we discard some values (the 1's) and get </br>
<pre>L2 = [2 3 5 <u>9</u> 3 6 5 3 5]</pre>
now if we continue and choose the first value, 2, as a pivot we end up discarding nothing more and get </br>
<pre>L3 = [2 3 5 <u>9</u> 3 6 5 3 5]</pre>
and we've gotten nowhere...<br>
so if the pivot ends up in the first place we have to rotate the list (ie move first element to end) and try again.
</p>

<h3>corner case 2</h3>

<p>
what a surprise, there's another corner case....</br>
this algorithm doesn't solve that case though when all elements of the list are the same</br>
<pre>L1 = [3 3 3 3 3]</pre>
no amount of rotation will save us now.</br>
so we need some special handling for this one;</br>
it's simply; if list min = list max then the median is the first element
</p>

<h3>a few shortcuts</h3>

<p>
if we ever end up looking for the 1st order stat we can just scan for the minimum</br>
if we ever end up looking for the kth order stat of a k element list we can just scan for the maximum</br>
