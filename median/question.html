<h2>the question</h2>

<p>i had an interview questions once which was "how would you find the median of a trillion integers
spread across a thousand machines"
</p>

<p>
though i managed to bumble my way to an answer that was generally on the right
track i've never gone through my solution in detail,</br>
so here goes....
</p>

<p>
firstly; what's a median? </br>
informally the median of a list of elements is the "middle" element after the list is sorted.
</p>

<p>
eg for a sorted list with 11 elements [1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 5 6 9]</br>
the median of this list is the value in the "middle" with 5 elements on either side</br>
ie. the value 4
</p>

<p>
so what makes this question about medians worthy of an interview question?
</p>

<p>
doing some back of envelope calculations we see that a trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) ints would consume, at 4 bytes per int, </br>
4x10<sup>12</sup> bytes = 4x10<sup>9</sup> kb = 4x10<sup>6</sup> mb = 4x10<sup>3</sup> gb.</br>
spread over 1,000 machines thats 4gb worth of ints per machine.
</p>

<p>
not so easy to just sort...
