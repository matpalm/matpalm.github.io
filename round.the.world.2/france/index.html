<p><img border="5" src="p1.jpg" /><br />our stopover in france this time was in the small southern town of prades</p>
<p><img border="5" src="p2.jpg" /><br />not a whole lot was going on in prades, which was sort of why we chose to go there</p>
<p><img border="5" src="p3.jpg" /><br />a short walk from the town was the abbaye saint michel de cuixa</p>
<p><img border="5" src="p4.jpg" /><br />out the back was a nice little orchid. how quaint!</p>

<p><font color="blue" size="5"><i>eus</i></font></p>

<p><img border="5" src="e1.jpg" /><br />another reason to visit prades was that it was down the road from eus, one of frances "most beautiful villages" </p>
<p><img border="5" src="e2.jpg" /><br />the windy streets up and down the hill were quite cool</p>

<p><font color="blue" size="5"><i>villafranche</i></font></p>

<p><img border="5" src="v1.jpg" /><br />a bit further inland on the bus was the village of villafranche</p>
<p><img border="5" src="v3.jpg" /><br />it was quite unique in that it was basically a fortress enclosed on all sides but huge walls and scary spikey things</p>
<p><img border="5" src="v2.jpg" /><br />ren was keen to take this car. ren's renault!</p>
