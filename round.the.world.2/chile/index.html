the city of santiago is a like a lot of south america cities, quite a mix of old and new. we didn't actually do much in santiago, spent a few days wandering around but wanted to 
go out to the ocean

about a 100km away is the coast and the old coast side city of valparaiso. here's ren wandering the small streets near the old area of cerro conception.

<p><img border="5" src="c03.jpg"></br>valparaiso is famous for it's "ascendors"; short funicular railways that take people up and down the steeps slopes of town.

<p><img border="5" src="c04.jpg" width="640"></br>and here's valparaiso from the top of the ascendor in the last shot. they have what looks like a nice coastline but it's all port and not open to public.

<p><img border="5" src="c05.jpg"></br>the town of vina del mar is next to valpariso and has one of the few easter island statues outside of easter island!

<p><img border="5" src="c06.jpg"></br>vina del mar does has public access to the beach, but they don't do much with it.

<p><img border="5" src="c07.jpg"></br>lots of statues near the coastline. here's someone important but shame about the name...

<p><img border="5" src="c08.jpg"></br>and speaking of unfortunate names; who thought this would be a good name?! <a href="http://www.snobsweater.com/">snob sweater?!</a> you're fired!
