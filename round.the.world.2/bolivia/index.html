<p><img border="5" src="b1.jpg"></br>la paz is a rather large urban sprawl of a city nestled in a three sided valley. lots of markets and houses on the hills stretching off into the distance. 

<p><img border="5" src="b2.jpg"></br>at 3600m it is quite a shock to the system when you arrive. this can of pringles is a good demonstration of the pressure difference. other things that exploded on us include shampoo and sunscreen.

<p><img border="5" src="b3.jpg"></br>here's a shot of the cbd from a neaby mirador (lookout). houses, houses and more houses...

<p><img border="5" src="b4.jpg"></br>we stayed not too far from the witches market where along with dried llama fetus' (which are buried in house foundations for good luck) you can get stuffed cats! lovely.

<p><img border="5" src="b5.jpg"></br>a few hours out of la paz on the way to the peru border are the pre-inca ruins of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku">tiwanaka</a> people. it was quite amazing to see that the ruins are still being excavated. there is a <b>lot</b> of empty flat grassland there so who knows how much they'll turn up.

<p><img border="5" src="b6.jpg"></br>part of the ruins were temples where previously head priests had their "portraits" spookily hung on the walls.
