<p><img border="5" src="a1.jpg" /><br />we had a few days in amsterdam. was just as we expected with lot of bikes crossing lots of canels.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="a2.jpg" /><br />did someone mention bikes? there are sooooo many in amsterdam.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="a3.jpg" /><br />dropped in to see a few museums including the van gogh one which had surprisingly few van goghs!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="a4.jpg" /><br />also visited anne franks house, though it's changed a bit since the war. extremely eerie...</p>
