<p><font color=blue size=5><i>huaraz</i></font></p>

<p><img border="5" src="h1.jpg"></br><p>eight hours on the bus from lima and you're in downtown huaraz. nice views, in the distance at least..</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h2.jpg"></br><p>as i mentioned earlier the elections were on and here, as everywhere, most walls had political graffiti.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h3.jpg" name="h3"></br><p>huaraz is surrounded by massive mountains with, droooool, endless amazing climbing spots. to get a feel for the scale zoom in on 
<u><a onmouseover="blah('3','3b')" onmouseout="blah('3','3')">these big trees</a></u>. we drove through a valley that looked like this for hours.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h4.jpg"></br><p>huaraz is definitely a big climbing spot. check out the door mat to the cafe down the road from us! (for those not in the know that's a climbing rope)</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h5.jpg"></br><p>another amazing view!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h6.jpg" name="h6"></br><p>this is peru's highest mountain, the mighty huascaran. from here it's another 3000m to go to summit, i'll be back by lunch (not!). in another attempt to understand  scale in these lo res pictures
<u><a onmouseover="blah('6','6b')" onmouseout="blah('6','6')">these dots</a></u>
are full sized trees on the way to the top.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h7.jpg"></br><p>the blue waters of laguna llanganuco under huascaran</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h6c.jpg"></br>it's not all peaches and cream though. in 1970 a huge earthquake broke off a "chunk" of 15 <b>million</b> cubic metres of dirt, snow and ice from the side of huascaran (that's a cube about 250m on each side). the town of yungay was 14 kilometres away and it just took 4 minutes for this avalanche to hit it. about 100 of 20,000 people survived. this pic is the remains of a bus.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="h8.jpg"></br><p>chivay has some remarkable town ruins all of which are underground. a complex series of small ventilation tunnels keep the air fresh. these ruins, 900BC, are much older than machu picchu (1400AD)</p>
