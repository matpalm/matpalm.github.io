<p><img border="5" src="c1.jpg" /><br />we visited colorado springs to see kasey, todd and wren. they have a great house looking out over the mountains.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c2.jpg" /><br />one of our day trips was out to the nearby rock formations at the "garden of the gods" where wren got in some walking practice</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c3.jpg" /><br />another day trip was out to a nearby huge canyon. notice the blue rafts off for some white water rafting.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c4.jpg" /><br />we also got a bit of freefall from the "skycoaster".</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c5.jpg" /><br />at nearby manitau springs we got to check out some old indian cave dwellings.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c6.jpg" /><br />wren favorite thing to do in the car was pointing out trucks and calling out "truck". getting this close had him speechless (but still pointing).</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c7.jpg" /><br />for our last trip out we took a cog rail train up to the top of pikes peak.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c8.jpg" /><br />here's ren and kasey at the top with the rockies in the background.</p>
