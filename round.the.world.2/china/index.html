<p><img border="5" src="c01.jpg" /><br />here we are at tiananmen square. and this is when it's tourist low season... i'd hate to be here when it's busy</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c02.jpg" /><br />strange things happen in asia. like people who want a photo taken with a western stranger... here's mr red shirt thanking me for being in his holiday snap.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c03.jpg" /><br />the six official mascots for the beijing olympics are, from left to right, bluechan, pandalike, rensan, haironfierto, evileyesorangji and greenda.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c04.jpg" /><br />ahhhh, fresh chinese air! this is how smoggy it was the entire time we were there. and yes, that weird orange mark on the right is the sun. doctors advise against running for half the year in beijing since the smog you inhale is worse than the benefit of the exercise. joy!</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c05.jpg" /><br />a few temples has these old guys walking around doing caligraphy on the ground in water</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c06.jpg" /><br />one of the many grounds in one of the many emperor's palaces</p>

<p><img border="5" src="c09.jpg" /><br />on the way home we stopped at the enormous grounds of the ming tombs</p>
