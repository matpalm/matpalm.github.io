<p><font color="blue" size="10"><i>canada</i></font></p>

<p><font color="blue" size="5"><i>toronto</i></font></p>

<p><img border="5" src="t1.jpg" /><br />toronto, another big north american city.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="t2.jpg" /><br />one of it's famous landmarks is the huge cn tower. it's got a cool glass floor you can jump up and down on.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="t3.jpg" /><br />in the bay right next toronto is an amazing tree covered car free island with lots of bike paths and stuff. </p>
<p><img border="5" src="t4.jpg" /><br />here's ren on said island; a great get away for city goers</p>

<p><font color="blue" size="5"><i>niagra falls</i></font></p>

<p><img border="5" src="nf1.jpg" /><br />a few hours south of toronto are niagra falls. as with most famous places we were <b>not</b> the only people about.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="nf2.jpg" /><br />we went on the popular maid-of-the-mist ride up to the base of the falls. it was remarkable the noise and, as the name would suggest, the mist.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="nf3.jpg" /><br />the falls are even lit up at night, bit spooky really.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="nf4.jpg" /><br />while there we decided to open a restaurant but as always they spelt kelcey wrong!</p>

<p><font color="blue" size="5"><i>calgary</i></font></p>

<p><img border="5" src="c1.jpg" /><br />on the other side of canada is calgary, a pleasant city not too far from the rockies</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c2.jpg" /><br />they even have couches on the street. (look carefully, those bricks aren't painted on)</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c3.jpg" /><br />they even have beavers, and they actually do eat through trees.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="c4.jpg" /><br />calgary has a very simple street naming scheme. avenues runs north/south, streets run east/west. this photo was taken 12 streets to the west of center street and 13 avenues south of the river. very simple, why aren't all places like this?</p>

<p><font color="blue" size="5"><i>banff</i></font></p>

<p><img border="5" src="b1.jpg" /><br />banff is one of the closest towns to calgary in the rockies.</p>
<p><img border="5" src="b2.jpg" /><br />quite a bit of wild life...</p>
<p><img border="5" src="b3.jpg" /><br />...both big and small</p>
<p><img border="5" src="b4.jpg" /><br />classic views!</p>
