<p><img border="5" src="tas01.jpg"></br>first stop on our round the world trip was stuart's place (aka ren's dad). here he is showing us some recent work on his boat.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas02.jpg"></br>we started our driving tour in boat harbour. thanks again janine for trusting us with your van!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas04.jpg"></br>first stop was cradle mountain. we were lucky with a clear day.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas05.jpg"></br>next down to lake barrington to spend the night. here's the van, a great portable home with everything we'd ever need for a driving fun time.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas06.jpg"></br>now here's a rare sight! ren behind the wheel. just look at that serious concentration!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas07.jpg"></br>after barrington we stopped in at nearby tasmazia, a huge hedge maze complex.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas08.jpg"></br>not only do they have hedge mazes but the world's smallest world heritage area where i got in some trekking practice.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas09.jpg"></br>ren in the meantime was off visiting friends.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas10.jpg"></br>next we went through to binalong bay. here's the amazingly deserted beach of the bay of fires. great stuff.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas11.jpg"></br>from time to time though we were harassed by the locals. honestly mr wallaby, does this gas cylinder look edible to you??</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas12.jpg"></br>down to freycinet national park and after a hike up mt amos we had our first look at wineglass bay.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas13.jpg"></br>then further south to the ever spooky port arthur to look around the ruins.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas15.jpg"></br>somewhere along the way we must have annoyed some ducks who ganged up on us in oatlands.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas16.jpg"></br>finally back to stuarts place to drop off the van.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas17.jpg"></br>next stop; matt and sarah's wedding. here's mat with a terrible i've-forgotten-something look. don't worry matt, sarah's fine!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas18.jpg"></br>and here she comes! with her soon-to-be new sister (emily) and brother (john) trying to get into my shot!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas19.jpg"></br>aahhhhh. what a lovely couple!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="tas20.jpg"></br>aahhhhh! what a place for a wedding! the source of my fav beer, cascade!</p>
