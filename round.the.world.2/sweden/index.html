<p><img border="5" src="s1.jpg" /><br />we took some time to stay with the lovely tammy and mahesh and new family addition poppy in almhult (the birthplace of ikea, no less!)</p>

<p><img border="5" src="s2.jpg" /><br />we were lucky enough to experience poppy's first bike ride and just look how much she is loving wearing a helmet. tammy you look so guilty!</p>

<p><img border="5" src="s3.jpg" /><br />they've brought this totally wicked place out in the country on a few acres of land. very wonderful place.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="s4.jpg" /><br />tammy took us for a few day trips including to see the old castle at kalmar.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="s5.jpg" /><br />sweden was our first taste of mainland europe's love of bikes. bikes, bikes and more bikes!</p>

<p><font color="blue" size="5"><i>stockholm</i></font></p>
