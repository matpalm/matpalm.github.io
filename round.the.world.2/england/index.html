<p><img border="5" src="e1.jpg" /><br />here's ren and i on the meridian line near jame and adeles place. east meets west indeed.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e2.jpg" /><br />nearby is this boat. remember those 3d eye pictures, give it a go.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e3.jpg" /><br />while adele was off working (ahhh, the joys of being unemployed) we went up to leeds to visit paul and jacinta.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e4.jpg" /><br />lots of cool bridges to cross</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e5.jpg" /><br />paul became one with nature (though we had to visit him for the next week in hospital (just kidding))</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e6.jpg" /><br />here's jacinta taking a picture of me taking a picture of her taking a picture of me...</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e7.jpg" /><br />ren did a day trip to hogwarts</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e8.jpg" name="e8" /><br />feel like buying a small apartment? what about this one, not too far from hyde park, enough room for visitors and the <u><a onmouseover="blah('e8','e8b')" onmouseout="blah('e8','e8')">price</a></u>, quite affordable really..</p>

<p><img border="5" src="e9.jpg" /><br />one of the best things about london is it's museums, most of which are free. here for example is <i>the</i> original dna model. how cool is that?</p>
