<p><img border="5" src="m1.jpg" /><br />here's the reason we came to miami. beach beach beach. we never got into town and basically became beach bums for the time we were there. the beaches were far more clean than i thought they would be and the water was fantastically warm</p>

<p><img border="5" src="m5.jpg" /><br />miami is famous for it's art deco buildings. it was fun to wander the streets and imagine we were back in the sixties.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="m4.jpg" /><br />internet cafes are way expensive in america. quite a shock coming from peru where it's about 1/12 of the price (who knows why?!?!) and the technology wasn't so great.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="m2.jpg" /><br />the life guards were out and luckily we never had to call them.</p>

<p><img border="5" src="m6.jpg" /><br />more cool old buildings</p>

<p><img border="5" src="m7.jpg" /><br />and even the occasional cool old car!</p>
