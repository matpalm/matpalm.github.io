<h1>simple supervised learning</h1>
<h2>part 1: should i read it? the m-algorithm</h2>

<p>
there is lots and lots of stuff online, way more than there is enough time to read.</br>
more importantly there's heaps i wouldn't <b>want</b> to read, even if i did have the time.</br>
how can a machine help me decide what to read and what to ignore?
</p>

<p>
lets write a program to try to decide, given an article from an rss feed whether it thinks i would like it.</br>
it's inputs will be the words of the article and it's output will be whether i should read it or not.
</p>

<p>
as a measure of how good the algorithm is i'll consider the percentage of times i agree with it's recommendation.</br>
so, as a start, what's the worse performance an algorithm could have? that i agree with it 0% of the time?</br>
not really. agreeing with it 0% of the time is the same as disagreeing with it 100% of the time.</br>
in that case i'd just do what it told me <b>not</b> to do; ie read the article if it said i didn't like it and vice versa.</br>
actually the worse performance is if i agree with it 50% of the time.
</p>

<p>
with that said the first algorithm that we'll consider as a baseline for performance is a coin toss.
</p>

<p>
but we actually want, for helping in comparing things, a deterministic coin toss,</br>
(ie one that returns the same value each time you ask it the same question.)</br>
so let's decide to read the article if the first letter of the first word is is in the first half of the alphabet (letters before and including m).</br>
i call this the <i>m</i>-algorithm. <small>(and i'll write <i>m</i> in italics to make it look a bit more scientific)</small></br>
should be correct roughly 50/50.
</p>

<p>
but how do we test this idea?</br> 
i'm too lazy to read a bunch of articles and say whether i liked them or not.</br>
but i can say two things...</br>
<ol>
<li> i wouldn't want to read any articles from los angeles celebrity gossip rss feed <a href="http://perezhilton.com">perezhilton.com</a>
<li> i do read most articles from the rss feed for the <a href="http://theregister.co.uk">theregister.co.uk</a>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
so can the <i>m</i>-algorithm correctly recommend i read each article from the register and recommend i don't read any article from perez hilton?</br>
let's take 4,500 articles from each of the feeds over the last six months and see how it goes...</br>
for the 9,000 articles it has an accuracy of 53.1%, pretty much what we expected
</p>

<p>
here's the <a href="http://github.com/matpalm/rss-feed-experiments/blob/master/classifier/m_algo.rb">code</a> and <a href="../perez_register_small.bz2">a small dataset</a> to try it with.</br>
<tt>&gt; bunzip2 -c perez_register_small.bz2 | ./really_complex_m_algorithm.rb</tt>
</p>
 
 <p>
 so we've got a baseline, lets try something a tad more intelligent, let's consider <a href="../p2/">word occurences</a>
