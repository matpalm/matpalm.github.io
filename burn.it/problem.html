<h1>should i burn it?</h1>

<h2>the bin, on in this case dvd, packing problem</h2>

<p>
i've got a number of animations and working files in folders.</br>
they vary in size from a few hundred mb to over a gb.</br>
to back them up i usually wait until i have enough to fit on a dvd.</br>
occasionally though i get slack and end up with 6 or 7 gbs worth that i still haven't archived.</br>
</p>

<p>
so my problem is to choose a set of the folders to burn so that the free space on the dvd is minimised</br>
algorithm nerds might notice this is very similiar to the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem">bin packing problem</a>
</p>

<p>
so here are my 16 folders with their sizes in bytes
<pre>
209964	./rgb checker spheres
535228	./360statue
345172	./4step
1137844	./9blobs
347508	./a minute of pi
943540	./back2revisited
646040	./bw meta reflect2
455616	./bw nye spin
535436	./chocolate stand
257348	./closed motor particles
924450	./rgb torus reflect
437804	./the cell
1627414	./underlay
496676	./wideanglecheckers
1102636	./wideangls
1276884	./yellow_react_skyl
</pre>
</p>

<p>
my first approach is ye olde <a href="brute_force.html">brute force</a>
