<h1>mame box project</h1>
<h2>like a million other people out there i have decided to make a mame arcade box!</h2>

<hr><h2>1998</h2>
<h3>introduced to the joy of <a href="http://www.mame.net/">mame</a> by morgan. was a bit more primitive back then though. it was running the likes of rush'n smash, black tiger, bubble bobble (and, of course, galaga).</br></br>
damn, even my ipaq can run games like <a href="cefrogger.jpg">frogger</a></br></br>
i have only recently seen it run strider and raiden without lots of glitches. i used to run rygar under the <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/single/rem.shtml">REM! project</a> but since i've got a newer rom set it is better under mame.

<hr><h2>2001</h2>
<h3>read about ppl hacking old arcade controls to get them to work with mame. a great idea but implementation of wiring up a pulled apart keyboard sounds like a nightmare and i'm too lazy/busy to do all the hard work

<hr><h2>aug 2002</h2>
<h3>read about a simple piece of hardware from a company called <a href="http://www.ultimarc.com">ultimarc</a> to convert the signals from arcade controllers to keyboard signals through a ps2 connection! saves all the hassle of wiring stuff up! hmm, motivation rising....

<hr><h2>sep 2002</h2>
<h3>did some more research and it seems the ultimarc product is the best. i think i should just order some controllers and make a simple prototype (without the cabinet) by just making the controller panel...

<hr><h2>1st nov 2002</h2>
<h3>righto. ordered some controllers stuff and the ipac2 from the states. just under $200 :( damn exchange rate. ordered...
<li>the hardware convertor
<li>two old style controllers
<li>15 buttons (2x6 for street fighter style plus some spares)
<li>1 and 2 player start buttons :)

<h3>phased approach will be...

<li>1. assemble them into a controller board (asap)
<li>2. get old pc to run linux/xmame being mamebox (in a year or so)
<li>3. get mamebox to work with tuner card and old tv (in maybe another year or so)
<li>4. assemble into cabinet with an old 21" cga arcade monitor (2nd hand for under $400) (when i'm 50)

<h3>however if i manage to see an cabinet going second hand anywhere...

<h3>did some benchmarking of mame0.61b under win2k. ran everything at 0 frame skip (no auto adjustment) to see what the box could do. my main box is a dual p3 1ghz, the jukebox is a celeron 300Mhz. perhaps this will help me work out what box i need..

<h3>wow! after only a week the parts have arrived! cripes, that was fast.
<p>here's the joystick and a button. cool.
<p><img border=10 src="joy_but.jpg"/>
<h3>so for a first prototype i've cut out some holes for a joystick and 6 buttons for now. first lesson learnt: given the joystick screws onto the bottom of the board the width of the board takes away from the length of the joystick. for this reason the prototype joystick feels a little short.
<p><img border=10 src="proto1_empty.jpg"/>&nbsp;<img border=10 src="protohole.jpg"/>
<h3>so after a bit of wiring it's ready to go!!!
<p><img border=10 src="proto1_wiring.jpg"/>&nbsp;<img border=10 src="proto1.jpg"/>
<h3>here's the basic layout, if anyone is interested, click for a bigger version

<h3>right. time for prototype 2! this time we need a coin drop, player 1 and 2 start, room for another lot of controls and some other control buttons (such as pause for when the action in 'raiden' just gets toooo much for me to handle)
<p><img border=10 src="proto2_empty.jpg"/>
<h3>wow, look at all those wires
<p><img border=10 src="proto2_wires.jpg"/>&nbsp;<img border=10 src="proto2_ipac.jpg"/>
<h3>prototype 2! this should keep me going for awhile.
<p><img border=10 src="proto2.jpg"/>

<p>here's a bigger version of my dual controller layout. click for a bigger version
<p><a href="controller1.jpg"><img border=10 width=320 src="controller1_.jpg"/></a>

<p>my next immediate step is to cat proof. one guess what my cat wants to do when she can see all those wires! i'd like to get a old cabinet for it but they seem hard to get. if i try to make one i know it'll turn out a total disaster!

<hr><h2>20th apr 2005</h2>
<h3>well after a short delay (two and half years) i've done some more work on my arcade controls. at this rate i expect to be finished in 2020.</h3>
<p><h3>the biggest problem with prototype 2 was the loss of joystick length because i had
nothing to rout out a gap big enough to fit the joystick. nothing, until now!</h3>

<p><img border=10 src="jigsaw.jpg"/>
<h3>with this awesome $30 jigsaw i've finally got something to cut out a gap for the joystick so i can bolt it to the top rather than than bottom.</h3>

<p><img border=10 src="workbench.gif"/><img border=10 src="sizedoesmatter.jpg"/>
<h3>hoorah! so after some precision cutting i've got one joystick sorted. check out how much longer the left joystick is now! </h3>
<p><h3>eventually i'll do the other. but for now, i dub thee prototype 2.5!</h3>

<hr>
<h3>want list</h3>
<li><a href="http://www.ultimarc.com/avgainf.html">15hz video output for that true arcade refresh rate. $160</a>
<li><a href="http://www.zax.com.au/wellsgardner.html">hugemungous 27" arcade monitor (drool) $895</a>
<li>an actual cabinet!!!
