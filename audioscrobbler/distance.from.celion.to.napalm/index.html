<h2>2. the shortest path from celine dion to napalm death</h2>

<h3>idea</h3>

<p>here's another idea following on from my last <a href="http://matpalm.com/bands.like.the.bands.i.like">audioscrobbler experiment</a> </p>

<p>recall the similiarity data provided gives, for a particular artist, other artists that are similiar with a match level</p>

<p>by following the similiarity links from artist to artist we should be able to make a connection between any two artists...</p>

<h3>implementation</h3>

<p>i've written a 
<a href="http://github.com/matpalm/audioscrobbler-experiments">ruby version</a> of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm">dijkstra's shortest path algorithm</a> to try and find the shortest similiarity path between two artists</br>
(graphs generated by <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graph viz</a> and 
<a href="dots.tar.bz2">here</a> are the <tt>.dot</tt> files for the graphs on this page)</p>

<h2>examples</h2>

<h3>eg1 nofx to bad religion</h3>

<p>lets consider a simpler example of the relationship between two similiar southern californian punk bands; 
<a href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/nofx/similar.xml">nofx</a> and 
<a href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/bad+religion/similar.xml">bad religion</a></p>

<p>here's the derived search graph; lower numbers denote a higher degree of similiarity</p>
<p><img src="visited_graph.nofx_br.png"/></p>
<p>we started at nofx, tried lagwagon then no use for a name,</br>
it got too expensive to leave NUFAN so we switched back to rancid, operation ivy and tim armstrong</br>
after giving that line up tried pennywise and then finally bad religion</p>

<h4>interesting side note!</h4>

<p>an interesting artefact of the data (and how i choose to interpret it ) is that looking at the nofx data there is actually a relationship directly from nofx to bad religion!</br>
however it's cost, though a direct route, is more expensive than going via pennywise.</br>
i choose to use the total cost only and discard the number of nodes hopped</p>

<h4>eg2 nofx to frenzal rhomb</h4>

<p>lets try a bit of a longer hop, nofx to australian punk legends 
<a href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/frenzal+rhomb/similar.xml">frenzal rhomb</a></p>
<img src="shortest.nofx_fr.png"/>

<p>not that much longer in terms of the number of nodes but the relationship between NUFAN and frenzal rhomb is quite weak</p>

<p>how many nodes were searched in this instance? quite a few more as we can see below! that hop from NUFAN to frenzal was costly!</p>
<a href="visited_graph.nofx_fr.png">(here's the full size version)</a></p>
<a href="visited_graph.nofx_fr.png"><img border=0 src="visited_graph.nofx_fr.small.png"/></a>

<p>it's obvious that the depth of searching should be taken into account to some degree though;</br>
according to this graph nofx is more like grind core masters extreme noise terror (8 nodes apart with similiarity distance of 63.73)</br>
than frenzal rhomb (3 nodes apart but similiarity distance of 65.53)!

<h4>eg3 celion dion to napalm death</h4>

<p>lets go nuts. can we get a link between
<a href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/celion%20dion/similar.xml">celion dion</a> and 
<a href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/napalm%20death/similar.xml">napalm death</a>??</p>

<p>yep! as you can see from the left hand side! it took awhile but the link is there! it has to check 600+ artsits to find it but it's there</p>
<p>since similiarities are not bidirectional the path back from napalm death to celion dion takes many more hops, 4,500+</p>
<p>here's a graph of <a href="combined.jpg">both directions combined</a>, it's interesting so little of the path is shared both ways</p>
