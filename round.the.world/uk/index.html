<p><font color=blue size=10><i>last days in the united kingdom</i></font>

<p>after a few more weeks in london it was time to leave for the european mainland. but first a couple of days out of the city starting in....

<p><font size=8>avebury</font>

<p><img border=5 src=0297.jpg></br>avebury is home to the largest prehistoric <a href=../henge>henge</a> in britain! this is one side of it with the best remaining part of the stone monument. you can also make out the henge quite well here. each of these rocks is maybe 10 feet tall so the whole thing is quite big. we stayed in a hotel right in the middle of the circle (but nothing mystical happened)

<p><img border=5 src=0288.jpg><img border=5 src=0291.jpg></br>also in avebury is the west kennet long barrow! barrows were used as burial chambers and this one was used between 4000BC and 2000BC. that's quite awhile ago and is still in pretty good shape. they don't make 'em like they used to.

<p><font size=8>salisbury</font>

<p><img border=5 src=0308.jpg></br>a few hours south of avebury is salisbury home of another (slightly more commonly known) stone henge! this one is heaps smaller but pretty awe inspiring

<p><img border=5 src=0317.jpg></br>salisbury is also home to a whopping big cathedral with (apart from one of the few remaining copies of the magna carta) a really old clock in it. this is the oldest working clock in europe, built and running since the 1300's. it doesn't have a face since in those days a clock was used to control the ringing of the church bells.
