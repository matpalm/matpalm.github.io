<p><img border=5 src=wash08.jpg></br>our next stop was to visit the lovely kasey, todd and brandi in odenton (between baltimore and washington dc) not only are they lovely, but kasey and todd are now married!!! so further congratulations and the best of luck to them both for the future!

<p><img border=5 src=wash01.jpg></br>washington dc is home of the air and space museum, america's greatest collection of space bits and pieces. here is one of the prototypes of the viking landers that are now on mars
 
<p><img border=5 src=wash02.jpg></br>...they also have the original reentry module from apollo 11. 

<p><img border=5 src=wash03.jpg></br>...and they have a cray-1! one of the fastest computers (of it's time that is, give it a few years and our palm pilots will be fastest)

<p><img border=5 src=wash04.jpg></br>...and they have a gengis!!! when doing my thesis on artifical intelligence i did a bit of reading about this little robot walker.

<p><img border=5 src=wash06.jpg></br>in washington while we were walking along two huge army choppers landed on the grass in front of us, people ran out into black vans which then raced off to the whitehouse. we later heard from a police officer that they were only "general whitehouse staff" so nothing to get too excited about.

<p><img border=5 src=wash07.jpg></br>and here is the famous view from the lincoln monument!
