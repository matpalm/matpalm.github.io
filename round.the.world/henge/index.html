<p>a henge is a circular enclosure used for ceremonial purposes. to better explain what it is here is........

<h1>mats step by step instructions to make a henge</h1>

<p><img border=5 src=ground.jpg></br>1. find a bit of ground, preferrably flat, that already hasn't got a henge on it.

<p><img border=5 src=ditch.jpg></br>2. dig a large circular ditch.

<p><img border=5 src=henge.jpg><img border=5 src=sideview.jpg></br>3. using the dirt you just dug out build a mound.

<p><img border=5 src=henge_causeway.jpg></br>4. make a few ways in and well done! you have made a henge!!!!

<p><img border=5 src=monument.jpg></br>5. and if you're <i>really</i> keen you can put a monument in there too! in the olden days they would use stone or wood but, obviously since they did this 4000 years ago, there are no wood henge monuments left.
