<p><font color=blue size=10><i>london, again...</i></font>

<p>we got to spend a few more days in london on our way back through to the u.s. 

<p><img border=5 src=lon01.jpg></br>on my way to the tower of london down a spooky side street i found one of london's oldest and most notorious jails for which many others are named. 'the clink'. reading about how people spent their time here, and the things they had done "wrong" made me glad to be living when we are living...

<p><img border=5 src=lon02.jpg></br>here is tower bridge...

<p><img border=5 src=lon03.jpg></br>...and next to it on the left is the tower of london.

<p><img border=5 src=lon04.jpg></br>quite awhile ago one of the kings of england decided that the raven's were a symbol of the monarchy and if they ever left the tower then the empire would fall. since then the raven masters at the tower have raised the birds and kept them on the grounds. not only are these birds quite scary they are also huge, at least a foot and a half tall. and they aren't scared either, several of them were chasing kids around.

<p><img border=5 src=lon05.jpg></br>this is a cat that was wandering about stalking pigeons. i tell you what, it would have had NO chance against one of those ravens!

<p><img border=5 src=lon06.jpg></br>there is quite a bit of armour and weapons in the tower of london. here are some extreme examples. the smaller armour is a bit over three foot and belonged to a young prince (and was worn into battle) the taller one is of some eastern european giant, just under seven foot. don't think i'd like to meet him on the battlefield!!!
