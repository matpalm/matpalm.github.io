<p><img border=5 src=ven1.jpg></br>ahhhhh, venice. the most relaxing (urban) place in the world. no cars, no bikes, only walking and boats makes wandering these endless narrow streets and canals one the most enchanting experiences of our trip.

<p><img border=5 src=ven2.jpg></br>venice was built at the fall of the western roman empire. because of hordes of invading barbarians  the people of the veneto cities built a new city on the 117 small islands of a nearby coastal lagoon.

<p><img border=5 src=ven3.jpg></br>there was no accommodation in venice itself when we arrived so we stayed in mestre which is 15mins away on the bus. it was almost depressing have to leave after a day, getting on a bus after all the aimless wandering was a bit sad.

<p><a name=ven4><img border=5 src=ven4.jpg></br>here is us on a ferry going down the grand canal. it is the main waterway that weaves down through the whole of venice from the bus/train station to the ocean.

<p><img border=5 src=ven4a.jpg><img border=5 src=ven4b.jpg></br>pigeons (or "flying rats" according to sydney pigeon "lover" brad) abound in the main squares of venice. this cheeky scamp even tried to get into  my photo!! (without even asking) so i had to take another straight away.

<p><img border=5 src=ven5.jpg></br>what an amazing place. one of the places i will surely return to. one day of wandering was nowhere near enough. and maybe next time we will be able to afford a gondola ride (at 150,000 lire per hour, about $150 australian dollars, they are a bit costly....)

<p><img border=5 src=ven6.jpg></br>on a slightly unrelated topic though italy doesn't have 'twisties'. they do have 'fonzies' and in my humble opinion they are a bit nicer too!
