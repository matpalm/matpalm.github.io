<p><font color=blue size=10><i>some things about london</i></font>

<ol>

<li><h2>the clouds are strange</h2></li>
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0115.jpg></br>well, not <i>really</i> clouds in the usual sense... the amount of air traffic above london means that on a clearish day the sky is partially covered by trails from aircraft passing over.

<p><li><h2>there are no road rules</h2></li>
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0285.jpg></br>london operates on a simple traffic system of self organised criticality where it seems you are allowed to do anything you like in a car as long as no one dies (directly) as a result. an example of this is shown in the picture above of a 2way street. in london you are free to park in either direction on the side of the road (which i'm 90% sure in australia is not allowed)

<p><li><h2>asian is a broader term</h2></li>
<p><img border=5 src=witwicsd.jpg width=450></br>another fact that reminds me i'm away is someone born in india is classed generically as "asian" rather than specifically as "indian". this sortof makes sense since we are in europe rather than the south east asian.

<p><li><h2>there are lots of red things</h2></li>
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0114.jpg></br>the phone boxes (well, not the fancy new ones at least) are red and look like this. </br>i was hoping that they would be blue and look like the tardis but oh well. </br><i><b>newsflash</b>! ren has so rightly corrected me in that the tardis was actually a blue <b>police</b> box and not a normal telephone box</i>
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0123.jpg></br>this is a red letterbox. they, unlike the phone boxes, do look like what i thought they would.</br>however when first seeing one ten years of goodies repeats came down on me and i was expecting it to <a href=crazedpostbox.htm>jump up and attack me</a>
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0160.jpg></br>this is a red can of coke. they cost 40p and are 330ml in the uk unlike the australian 375ml cans. this is a probably a good thing since it means for every 25 cans i drink in london i would only drunk 22 cans worth in sydney. notice they also have the solo can style wide opening.
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0153.jpg></br>having praised the smaller can size there are no 1.25 litre bottles, only 1.5 litre bottles! that means that even though i lose 45ml on each can i gain 250ml on the bottles.<br><i>moral of this story: you just can't win (drink more cans, less bottles)</i>
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0232.jpg></br>it also seems that coke is sold in bottles in the uk. (though at 79p for 330ml means its a bit more than a can!). a <a name=bottleofcoke href=wiseman.htm>wise man</a> once told me that coke tastes different in plastic bottles or cans (and was able to tell the difference when tested) so i'd love to say that coke in a <b>glass</b> bottle is even better still, but i can't tell the difference :(
