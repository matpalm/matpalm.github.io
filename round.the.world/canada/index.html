<p>after some more plane rides we got to vancouver in the south west of canada.

<p><img border=5 src=can1.jpg></br> there are lots of trees in canada. this is a park just north of the city cbd.

<p><img border=5 src=can2.jpg></br> at this place they had this lake called 'beaver lake' though i think we got ripped off, not a beaver in site!

<p><img border=5 src=can3.jpg></br>we did get to see some chipmunks though and they are really fast! here is one escaping into the bushes. see that bit to the left of the tree stump where the brown is a different colour. well that's a chipmunk. really. 

<p><img border=5 src=can4.jpg></br>and here is the view of vancouver from the park. it is quite close.

<p><img border=5 src=can5.jpg></br>we took a bus a few hours to the east of vancouver to the ski village of whistler. here is a picture from one of the slopes but you may notice something missing! yes, no snow. in winter this is covered but it was summer so no skiers (loads of mountain bikers!)

<p><img border=5 src=can6.jpg></br>it is also bear country! and here is ren with a bear! though it was bear season we didn't get to see any bears :(

<p><img border=5 src=can7.jpg></br>here is the closest we got to a real bear. this tree was shredded. i'm glad this happened to a tree and not me!

<p><img border=5 src=can8.jpg></br>and finally here is view from whistler peak looking out to the right of blackcomb. another nice view to finish things with.

<p>a few days later after 30+ hours in transit via l.a. we were back in sydney. hmmm, now where to next time?
