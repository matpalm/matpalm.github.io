<p>we spent our first 5 days out of sydney in perth with the lovely cheryl, abe and jack. finally i have a few scans to show you! but none of jack sorry :(

<p><img border=5 src=DSCE06.jpg><img border=5 src=DSCE07.jpg></br>here are cheryl and abe. alas cheryl seems a bit camera shy so here is an <a href=DSCE06_.jpg>"artist's rendition"</a> of what she may have looked like with her coffee down. and if you think that picture is scary what about the time i went <a href=pb4_clones.jpg>paintballing with a bunch of my clones?</a>

<p><img border=5 src=DSCE02.jpg><img border=5 src=DSCE05.jpg></br>there is lots of desert in western australia. we made a trip up north about 4-5 hours to the pinnacles. quite impressive.

<p><img border=5 src=DSCE01.jpg></br>we also went about 5 hours south to margaret river to visit peppa who is a friend of ren's. this picture of ren and peppa is taken in the block of land she and wade are about to build a house on
