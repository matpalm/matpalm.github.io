<h1>buckingham palace</h1>
<p><img border=5 src=buckingham.jpg> <font color=red><b>images</b></font><br>
the first morning we arrived in london we had a few (8) hours to kill so we had a wander around the city a bit and walked past buckingham palace
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0086_.jpg><font color=red><b>1</b></font></br>this is buckingham palace where the queen hangs out, sometimes.</br> there are guards out the front who stay very still and change every once in awhile but we weren't around for long enough to see. 
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0088_.jpg><font color=red><b>2</b></font></br>this is a statue of queen victoria that is just outside the front of buckingham palace</br>from the size of the steps at the front you can get some idea of how large it actually is. maybe one of us should have got <a href=DSCF0088__.jpg>in the picture</a>, it may that would have made it easier to understand the size.
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0091_.jpg><font color=red><b>3</b></font></br>these are some flowers that are in st. james park on the way to the thames.

<h1>hyde park</h1>
<p><img border=5 src=hydepark_.jpg width=710> <font color=red><b>images</b></font><br>
next on our first day we walked through hyde park (not very far at all from buckingham palace)
<p><img border=5 src=hydepark_all.jpg><br>this is the whole of hydepark so you have some idea of the total size when looking at my pictures<br>
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0094_.jpg><font color=red><b>1</b></font></br>this is us in hyde park. please excuse our crazed look and slightly messed up hair. we had been on a plane thirteen hours that had arrived in london that morning at six.
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0093_.jpg><font color=red><b>1</b></font></br>here are some guys in fancy clothes riding horses through the park. that is an interesting factor in london, all the parks have quite wide horseways where you can ride your horse.<br>after all, in a huge city like london everyone has a horse, of course (?!?)
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0102.jpg><font color=red><b>2</b></font></br>heres a walkway in the park.  theres a running track, a bike track and on the right is the horseway.
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0099_.jpg><font color=red><b>3</b></font></br>there is a little island and paddle boat hire in the serpentine in hyde park. this picture, together with the aerial shot and the map hopefully gives some idea of how big the park actually is (ie very)
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0101_.jpg><font color=red><b>4</b></font></br>this is view across the serpentine back towards to city. you can see "the clubhouse" on the right, which looks like a very expensive restaurant (or something similiar)
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0103_.jpg><font color=red><b>5</b></font></br>heres ren in the park. in the background is the albert memorial.

<h1>golders green</h1>
<p><img border=5 src=golders.jpg><font color=red><b>image</b></font></br>
golders green is a nothern suburb where we first stayed when we came to london.
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0107_.jpg><font color=red><b>1</b></font></br>this is a picture of the hostel we stayed in.<br>it is a beautiful building (as most are in london)</br>a lot of rich people live around in these streets. the houses are fantastic.<br>it is quiet and near hampstead heath.
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0124.jpg><font color=red><b>2</b></font></br>this is where the shops are in golders green.<br>more nice buildings in the streets.<br>

<h1>belsize park</h1>
<p><img border=5 src=belsize.jpg><font color=red><b>image</b></font></br>
belsize park is where we stayed after the youth hostel in golders green
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0110.jpg><font color=red><b>1</b></font></br>here is house we stayed in. there are a bundle of "rooms" in this short let place. another nice building.
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0111.jpg><font color=red><b>2</b></font></br>this is view down the street we walk to get to the shops and the tube station
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0113.jpg><font color=red><b>3</b></font></br>here's another side street on the way
<p><img border=5 src=DSCF0126.jpg><font color=red><b>4</b></font></br>this is our local pub. "the rat and parrot".</br>they have lots of nice beers but the only cider is strongbow on tap so ren doesn't like it much.
