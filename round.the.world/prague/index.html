<p><font color=blue size=10><i>prague</i></font>

<p><img border=5 src=0344.jpg></br>our first stop flying out of the united kingdom was the czech republic's capital prague. prague is a beautiful old city, one of the few in europe to not have been bombed during any wars and as a result there is an amazing collection of different styles of building.

<p><img border=5 src=0338.jpg></br>this is another church in the town square. this is a classic example of one of the three different architectures in prague, but i've forgotten what it's call, oops, sorry.

<p><img border=5 src=0351.jpg></br>this is a famous bridge, called "charles bridge", leading from the city centre towards the really huge prague castle. there are a series of statues along each side of the bridge. this statue is of saint wenceslas and saint sigmund, doing something important by the looks of things.

<p><a name=DSCF0350a><img border=5 src=DSCF0350a.jpg></br>here is ren and i with some arches of the charles bridge to the right and the prague castle to the left on the hill. the guy that took this didn't seem very happy having to take a photo but we're smiling anyways

<p><img border=5 src=0358.jpg></br>here are some more buildings. this part of town has lots of little twisty and turny cobblestone streets.

<p><img border=5 src=0361.jpg></br>at the top of a huge hill in prague is an hall of mirrors. we were lost for about 8 days and had to live off a single museli bar and the "drippings from the ceilings", but not really ;)
